We had time to review concepts like ERD, ERM, and DCL. With Jevgenia, I started working on the Tour Planner tasks, and we received feedback from the teacher. Our main challenge was that the Tour Planner had a **Tour** table, but we were unsure how to categorize certain data. To solve this, we created a table in Excel and did some brainstorming.  
I also had a small issue configuring XAMPP. I tried changing my port and later realized that MariaDB was installed. After uninstalling it, the problem was resolved, and the port was accepted. I was able to fix this issue with the help of a YouTube video.  
Next on my to-do list is to complete the **Tour Planner** task in MySQL. Additionally, I want to review some of the key concepts again to reinforce my understanding.

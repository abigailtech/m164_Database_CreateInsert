Today, I had a lot of questions because I realized that the exam is coming up next week. Since I always strive for a grade of 6, I want to give my best, be efficient with my time, and learn as much as possible. Thatâ€™s why I read about multiple relationships, recursion, and special relationships. Before this, I had never worked with these concepts, so understanding the theory was a bit complicated at first. However, after asking questions, I was able to understand it better. I also finalized the installation and now have a clearer understanding of how MySQL Workbench works. Specifically, I now understand how to switch between query language and table view, as well as how to create a database. Additionally, I wrote a summary of what I learned today and completed a task related to query language and DDL. This weekend, I will prepare for the exam.

I was able to learn independently, so I took the time to compare the Tour Planner I worked on with Jevgenia to the provided solution. This allowed me to review the theory of identifying and non-identifying relationships. I also repeated key concepts about DBMS and wrote summaries and assignments in Word. I had planned to complete these tasks, and I managed to do so within the allotted time. Next, I hope to solve the upcoming exercises as well.

We had time to review concepts like ERD, ERM, and DCL. With Jevgenia, I started working on the Tour Planner tasks, and we received feedback from the teacher. Our main challenge was that the Tour Planner had a Tour table, but we were unsure how to categorize certain data. To solve this, we created a table in Excel and did some brainstorming.  
I also had a small issue configuring XAMPP. I tried changing my port and later realized that MariaDB was installed. After uninstalling it, the problem was resolved, and the port was accepted. I was able to fix this issue with the help of a YouTube video.  
Next on my to-do list is to complete the Tour Planner task in MySQL. Additionally, I want to review some of the key concepts again to reinforce my understanding.
